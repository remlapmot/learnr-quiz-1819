# learnr-quiz-1819

Quizzes used my R programming lab sessions for MATH550 and SCC461 modules in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Lancaster University.

Deployed at <https://remlapmot.shinyapps.io/math550-scc461-r-quizzes/>.

The quizzes were built using the [`learnr` package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html).
